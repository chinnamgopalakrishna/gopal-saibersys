
1. Simple
	- Java is simple as it contains lots of APIs(Application Programming Interfaces)
		or libraries

	eg:
		Arrays.sort(n);

2. Object Oriented
	- Java is object oriented as it supports all the OO features
	  like objects,classes,abstraction,encapsulation,inheritance
	  and polymorphism

3. Robust
	- Robust means Strong
	- In Java we can develop robust applications using Exception Handling
	  which avoids abnormal termination of program

4. Platform Independent
	- Refer diagram Platform Independent.png


5. Interpreted
	- java command is an interpreter
	- interpreter checks/executes the byte code line by line and if
	  any line contains error, the program will be terminated
	- javac is a compiler which converts source code into bytecode at a time

6. Portable
	- Java is portable as the size of all data types is same on all platforms (OS)

7. Secure
	- A pointer is a variable which contains the address of another variable
		C/C++
		-----
		int n=10;
		int *p = &n;//returns the address of n

	- Java is secure as Java does not support pointers as pointers violate secuity

8. Multithreaded
	- A thread is a light weight process under execution within a process
	- Multithreading is used to increase the performance of application

9. Dynamic
	- Memory allocation for arrays,strings, objects is done during runtime (dynamic)
	- Java is automatic garbage collection

10.Distributed
